# Kaggle-Competitions
I will provide resources that pertain to Kaggle competitions. I will primarily use TensorFlow for my models. I may also post tutorials outlining the use of Pandas for data analysis and modeling. 

I deploy all of my code onto a local server which I built. My server features and Intel Core i5-2400 CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and an nVidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti.
